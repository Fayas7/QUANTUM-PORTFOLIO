# Quantum Computing Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on quantum computing experiments and projects
implemented using **Qiskit**.  
It documents my step-by-step journey from quantum fundamentals to
quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning.

The focus of this portfolio is on **clear understanding, clean implementation,
and reproducible experiments** rather than theory-heavy exposition.

## 🧪 Current Contents

basics/

Hadamard Gate and Quantum Superposition
Demonstrates how a Hadamard gate creates an equal superposition of
|0⟩ and |1⟩. Measurement statistics are visualized using histograms.

Pauli-X Gate (Quantum NOT)
Shows how the Pauli-X gate deterministically flips a qubit from
|0⟩ → |1⟩, behaving as the quantum equivalent of a classical NOT gate.

Pauli-Z Gate (Phase Flip)
Demonstrates how the Pauli-Z gate flips the phase of a qubit without
changing its measurement outcome, highlighting the role of phase in
quantum systems.

More notebooks will be added incrementally as the portfolio grows.
