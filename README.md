# Quantum Computing Portfolio

This repository contains hands-on quantum computing experiments and projects
implemented using **Qiskit**.  
It documents my step-by-step journey from quantum fundamentals to
quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning.

The focus of this portfolio is on **clear understanding, clean implementation,
and reproducible experiments** rather than theory-heavy exposition.

## 🧪 Current Contents

basics/

- Hadamard Gate and Quantum Superposition
  Demonstrates how a Hadamard gate creates an equal superposition of
  |0⟩ and |1⟩. Measurement statistics are visualized using histograms,
  illustrating probabilistic quantum behavior.

- Pauli-X Gate (Quantum NOT)
  Shows how the Pauli-X gate deterministically flips a qubit from
  |0⟩ → |1⟩, behaving as the quantum equivalent of a classical NOT gate.

- Pauli-Z Gate (Phase Flip)
  Demonstrates how the Pauli-Z gate flips the phase of a qubit without
  changing its measurement outcome, highlighting the role of phase in
  quantum systems.

- Two-Qubit Quantum System
  Introduces joint quantum states and shows how measurement outcomes
  represent the combined state of multiple qubits rather than
  independent single-bit results.

- Bell State and Quantum Entanglement
  Demonstrates quantum entanglement using a Bell state, showing how
  measurement outcomes of two qubits are perfectly correlated even
  though each individual result is random.

More notebooks will be added incrementally as the portfolio grows.
